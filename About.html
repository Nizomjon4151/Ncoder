        <h3>About us</h3>
            <p>The Coding School (TCS) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization focused on preparing the next generation for the future of work through computer science training and workforce development. As pioneers in emerging technology education, we believe there is a critical - and unmet - need to provide students with the skills and knowledge in the technologies that will change the nature of how we conduct business, how we interact and connect, and society at large. We have a wide portfolio of initiatives, including flagship programs in Quantum Computing, Artificial Intelligence, and Big Data. To date, we have taught over 40,000 students from 125 countries, including K-12 students and educators, community college and university students, and members of the workforce. </p><br>
            <p class="bg-dark">It takes a village to develop 21st century education in emerging technologies. We are grateful for the support from our sponsors and partners who believe in our mission and help us ensure the future tech-ready workforce is diverse, inclusive, and equitable.</p>
