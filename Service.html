                <p>>Finally, teaching coding to students supports digital equity. Digital equity is defined by having equal skills to access, choose and effectively use digital technology to find, evaluate, create and communicate information regardless of gender, socioeconomic status, background or other factors. Being able to understand and manipulate code deepens a studentâ€™s ability to choose and use this digital technology. By teaching coding skills in schools, all students are empowered with future-ready digital literacy skills to succeed.</p> <br>

            <h3>Web Design</h3> <br>
                <p>>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.</p> <br>

            <h3>Mobile/Web app development</h3> <br>
                <p>>Two of the most common methods for designing websites that work well both on desktop and mobile are responsive and adaptive design. In responsive design, content moves dynamically depending on screen size; in adaptive design, the website content is fixed in layout sizes that match common screen sizes. </p> <br>
